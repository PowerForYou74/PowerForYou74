# Hey, I'm Oliver 👋

**Founder & Developer at [CellRepair AI](https://cellrepair.ai)** — building AI agents that make cellular health understandable for everyone.

## What I'm Working On

🏆 **AgentX Purple** — AI debate agent independently validated at 96.5% win rate (201/208) using the [RDI Foundation’s AgentBeats](https://agentbeats.dev) debate evaluation framework. Outperforms GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini Pro in structured patient education debates.

🧬 **CellRepair Health Educator** — Patient-friendly cellular health education powered by MedGemma 1.5 4B. Submitted to the [MedGemma Impact Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/med-gemma-impact-challenge) ($100K Kaggle competition). Runs on edge hardware — no cloud, no patient data leaves the device.

🔬 **CellRepair AI Platform** — A network of autonomous AI agents for health education, featuring LangChain and Claude MCP integrations, with a Hugging Face Space for interactive demos.
